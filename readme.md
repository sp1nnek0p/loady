# LOADY - Python/Django Load posting app

## Description

This is my first Django app, and I had to do alot of research to get this done.

The app allows users to come to the site register for a new account and post loads they need transported, and transporters can come and see loads that are available and speak directly to the their clients. 

I will be writting a new version of this that I will deploy to Heroku as this was purely a test to see not only what Django is capable of but to also test my self if I would be able a do a project like this. This project is not done, but it is in a working state. I saw what I would like to impove and will be starting with LOADY v2, within this week.
